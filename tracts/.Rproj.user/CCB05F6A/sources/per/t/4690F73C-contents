## Eastern Shore Place Names {.tabset}
The maps below summarize the notes and names generated from the Community Advisory Committee.

* Move between the tabs to see the tracts overlaid on different base maps with different underlying details.
* Zoom and center a map to view the area defined by a census tract more closely.
* Click anywhere within a tract to review the notes and potential names for that tract.

### Base Esri
```{r map1, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
leaflet(tracts) %>% 
  #addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.DeLorme") %>% 
  addPolygons(color = "black",
              weight = 2,
              fillOpacity = .1,
              popup = paste0("Tract Number: ", tracts$TRACTCE, "<br>",
                             "Notes/Names: ", tracts$names))
```
